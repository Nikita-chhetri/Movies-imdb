                                        **** MOVIE DATASET ANALYSIS **** 
                
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook documenting the exploratory data analysis of a movie dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
The entire notebook has been shared with comments placed accordingly for better understanding.
The project comprises essential Python codes for data analysis, from cleaning to transforming.
The visualization in Power BI has been shared in the png format.
This project can be helpful for beginners and will give them a lot of insights about data and how to handle them.
There are several ways of analyzing data depending on the goal and vision of an individual.
Contributions to enhance this project are highly appreciated. 
Feel free to suggest improvements, add new visualization or explore different analysis techniques.

**#To thoroughly explore the data, I created multiple notebooks, building upon previous analyses. While there might be some overlapping code, each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the data.**
